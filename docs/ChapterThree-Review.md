ChapterThree Review
===================

An expression of the model
--------------------------
Like mentioned in the overview, chapter three describes the importance of a Model-Driven Design. We have used this chapter to check our current implementation against the approach and added some business descriptions to our classes, so that you can look over them and compare the business expectations with the implementation.
Additionally, you can have a look at the [descriptions of the original cargo sample](http://dddsample.sourceforge.net/characterization.html) to get detailed information about some design decisions.

Domain-Driven Design Tools
--------------------------
Checkout our [collection of useful DDD tools and libraries](https://github.com/codeliner/php-ddd-cargo-sample/blob/master/docs/domain-driven-design-tools.md). The tools help you implement DDD and let you focus on the domain model, not on technical details.
