php-ddd-cargo-sample
====================

PHP Version of the cargo sample used in Eric Evans DDD book

This project is in a work in progress state. Your welcome to fork the repo and help to finish the cargo sample app for php.
The system is based on ZF2 to get a powerful application layer out of the box and uses Doctrine2 to persist it's aggregates. 
This would be a common combination in a large PHP project but it is not required. We want to focus on the implementation
of the domain model. The infrastructure and application layer can be replaced with any other PHP based components.
