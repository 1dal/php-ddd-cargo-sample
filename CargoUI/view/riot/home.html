                <p>The Cargo Shipping System is based on the example used in Eric Evans book Domain-Driven Design: <i>Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software</i>. It\'s a PHP Version of the Cargo Sample to show you how DDD can be applied to a PHP Project.
                   We are focused on the DDD implementation in this educational application so we tried to keep the surrounding layers as simple as possible.
